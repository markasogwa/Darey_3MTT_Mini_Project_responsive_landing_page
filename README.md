## Purpose
The purpose of this webpage is to act as a responsive landing page for a platform that offers online web development courses. It aims to engage potential learners by providing key information about the courses available and encouraging them to enroll. The page includes a hero section, a list of courses, and a footer with additional information, including contact details and quick links.

## Use Case
This landing page is designed for users interested in learning web development, particularly those seeking online courses. It helps users:
- Discover available web development courses.
- Learn more about the academy’s offerings.
- Easily navigate the website and find additional resources like contact information and policies.
- Enroll in the courses through clear call-to-action buttons.

## Requirements
To ensure proper functionality and appearance, the following requirements are necessary:
- **Web Browser**: A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) is required for full support of CSS and JavaScript features.
- **Internet Connection**: An active internet connection is needed to access external assets like images, stylesheets, and icons.
- **CSS**: The page relies on an external CSS file for styling and a Font Awesome library for icons.
- **JavaScript (optional)**: For enhanced interactivity (e.g., hamburger menu toggle on small screens), JavaScript may be used, though it’s not explicitly included in the HTML itself.

## Performance
- **Responsiveness**: The landing page is fully responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring an optimal experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Optimized Images**: The images (such as course images and logos) are optimized for faster loading times, providing a smooth experience even on slower connections.
- **Navigation**: The page features a mobile-friendly navigation system that includes a hamburger menu for compact devices, which expands on larger screens for easy navigation.
- **Minimal Load Time**: External resources (e.g., CSS and Font Awesome) are used to minimize the page's load time, allowing quicker access to the content.
- **Accessibility**: The website employs proper semantic HTML elements, such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, and `<main>`, ensuring better accessibility for users with disabilities or those using screen readers.

### Key Features:
- **Hero Section**: A large introductory section with a call-to-action button to entice users to get started with the courses.
- **Course Cards**: Displays detailed information about each course, with an option to enroll through a “Get this course” button.
